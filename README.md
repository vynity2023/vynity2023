The primary data prediction algorithm for our project utilizes Python, (specifically the Pandas and Scikit-learn libraries as of now)
We are using basic machine learning algorithms to predict future 1 day stock price of Bitcoin, we append this prediction to actual data and consider it as genuine information. 
We repeat this process 30 times to obtain a one-month prediction.
At the end we compare it with the real results to find how accurate it is.
